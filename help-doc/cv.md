OpenCV Learning Note
=====================

# Installation


## Errors
1. imshow and startWindowThread()
```
/io/opencv/modules/highgui/src/window.cpp:583: error: (-2) The function is not implemented. Rebuild the library with Windows, GTK+ 2.x or Carbon support. If you are on Ubuntu or Debian, install libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config, then re-run cmake or configure script in function cvShowImage
```
Guess : should build opencv from the source
