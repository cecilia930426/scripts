		"abstract": "Silicon photonics have emerged as a promising solution to meet the growing demand for high-bandwidth, low-latency, and\nenergy-efficient on-chip and off-chip communication in many-core processors. However, current silicon-photonic interconnect\ndesigns for many-core processors waste a significant amount of power because (a) lasers are always on, even during\nperiods of interconnect inactivity, and (b) microring resonators employ heaters which consume a significant amount of\npower just to overcome thermal variations and maintain communication on the photonic links, especially in a 3D-stacked\ndesign. The problem of high laser power consumption is particularly important as lasers typically have very low energy\nefficiency, and photonic interconnects often remain underutilized both in scientific computing (compute-intensive execution\nphases underutilize the interconnect), and in server computing (servers in Google-scale datacenters have a typical utilization\nof less than 30%). We address the high laser power consumption by proposing EcoLaser+, which is a laser control\nscheme that saves energy by predicting the interconnect activity and opportunistically turning the on-chip laser off when\npossible, and also by scaling the width of the communication link based on a runtime prediction of the expected message\nlength. Our laser control scheme can save up to 62 - 92% of the laser energy, and improve the energy efficiency of a manycore\nprocessor with negligible performance penalty. We address the high trimming (heating) power consumption of the\nmicrorings by proposing insulation methods that reduce the impact of localized heating induced by highly-active components\non the 3D-stacked logic die.",

However, current designs are primarily based on microrings, which are highly sensitive to temperature. As a result, current silicon-photonic interconnect designs expend a significant amount of energy heating the microrings to a designated narrow temperature range, only to have the majority of the thermal energy waste away and dissipate through the heat sink, and in the process of doing so heat up the logic layer, causing significant performance degradation to the cores and inducing thermal emergencies. We propose Parka, a nanophotonic interconnect that encases the photonic die in a thermal insulator that keeps its temperature stable with low energy expenditure, while minimizing the spatial and temporal thermal coupling between logic and silicon-photonic components. Parka reduces the microring energy by 3.8--5.4x and achieves 11--23% speedup on average (34% max) depending on the cooling solution used.",

		"abstract": "The communication bandwidth and power consumption of network-on-chip (NoC) are going to meet their limits soon because of traditional metallic interconnects. Photonic NoC is emerging as a promising alternative to address these bottlenecks. Photonic routers and silicon-waveguides are used to realize switching and communication respectively. In this paper, we propose a non-blocking, low power, and high performance 5×5 photonic router design using silicon microring resonators (MRR). Mode-division-multiplexing (MDM) scheme has been incorporated along with wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) and time-division-multiplexing (TDM) in the router to increase the aggregate bandwidth 4× times, making it a suitable candidate for high performance NoC. The technique proposed here is the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge. The MDM based design permits multi-modal (here 2 modes) communication. As compared to a high-performance 45nm electronic router, the proposed router consumes 95% less power. Further the results show 50% less power consumption and 75% less insertion loss when compared to most recently reported photonic router results.",

		"abstract": "Photonic Networks-on-Chip (PNoCs) have been proposed as a disruptive technology solution to the silicon problem showing their great superiority over their electronic counterparts. In these architectures, higher bandwidth can be achieved thanks to the light speed transmissions, and the power required to transmit over a distance is much lower. Despite these advantages, PNoC designs are very complex, and thus are more susceptible to physical defects and short-term malfunctions. Therefore, fault-tolerance has become a primordial requirement for these future generation high-performance systems. In this paper, we present a fault-tolerant optical router, named FTTDOR, with its electrical control module for highly reliable low-power 3D-Networks-on-Chip (PHENIC). It uses minimal redundancy to assure accuracy of the packet transmission even after faulty Microring Resonators (MRs) are detected. The fault-tolerant optical switch is decomposed nonblocking, with minimal MRs, and requires no MRs for straight transmission (East to West, North to South, and Up to Down, as well as their inverses). Simulation results show that the network can maintain 98% and 94% throughput when considering 3% and 20% fault-rates, respectively. These results come with 35% decrease in the number of MRs when compared to the conventional crossbar switch resulting in 32% power reduction.",

SiN-on-SOI platforms open the possibility for passive optical functionalities implemented in the SiN layer to be combined with active functionalities in the SOI. SiN layers can be integrated onto SOI using a front-end or back-end of line integration process flow. These photonic platforms support low-loss SiN waveguides, low-loss and low-crosstalk waveguide crossings, and low-loss interlayer transitions using adiabatic tapers. Novel ultra-broadband and efficient grating couplers as well as polarization management devices are enabled by the close coupling between the silicon and SiN layers.",

		"abstract": "Molecular-scale Network-on-Chip (mNoC) crossbars use quantum dot LEDs as an on-chip light source, and chromophores to provide optical signal filtering for receivers. An mNoC reduces power consumption or enables scaling to larger crossbars for a reduced energy budget compared to current nanophotonic NoC crossbars. Since communication latency is reduced by using a high-radix crossbar, minimizing power consumption becomes a primary design target. Conventional Single Writer Multiple Reader (SWMR) photonic crossbar designs broadcast all packets, and incur the commensurate required power, even if only two nodes are communicating. This paper introduces power topologies, enabled by unique capabilities of mNoC technology, to reduce overall interconnect power consumption. A power topology corresponds to the logical connectivity provided by a given power mode. Broadcast is one power mode and it consumes the maximum power. Additional power modes consume less power but allow a source to communicate with only a statically defined, potentially non-contiguous, subset of nodes. Overall interconnect power is reduced if the more frequently communicating nodes use modes that consume less power, while less frequently communicating nodes use modes that consume more power. We also investigate thread mapping techniques to fully exploit power topologies. We explore various mNoC power topologies with one, two and four power modes for a radix-256 SWMR mNoC crossbar. Our results show that the combination of power topologies and intelligent thread mapping can reduce total mNoC power by up to 51% on average for a set of 12 SPLASH benchmarks. Furthermore performance is 10% better than conventional resonator-based photonic NoCs and energy is reduced by 72%.",

		"abstract": "To meet energy-efficient performance demands, the computing industry has moved to parallel computer architectures, such as chip-multi-processors (CMPs), internally interconnected via networks-on-chip (NoC) to meet growing communication needs. Achieving scaling performance as core counts increase to the hundreds in future CMPs, however, will require high performance, yet energy-efficient interconnects. Silicon nanophotonics is a promising replacement for electronic on-chip interconnect due to its high bandwidth and low latency, however, prior techniques have required high static power for the laser and ring thermal tuning. We propose a novel nano-photonic NoC architecture, LumiNOC, optimized for high performance and power-efficiency. This paper makes three primary contributions: a novel, nanophotonic architecture which partitions the network into subnets for better efficiency; a purely photonic, in-band, distributed arbitration scheme; and a channel sharing arrangement utilizing the same waveguides and wavelengths for arbitration as data transmission. In a 64-node NoC under synthetic traffic, LumiNOC enjoys 50 % lower latency at low loads and ∼ 40 % higher throughput per Watt on synthetic traffic, versus other reported photonic NoCs. LumiNOC reduces latencies ∼ 40 % versus an electrical 2D mesh NoCs on the PARSEC shared-memory, multithreaded benchmark suite.",

The Helix-hnon-blocking photonic switch is developed to improve physical-layer and network performance parameters for a wide range of silicon nano-photonic multicore interconnection topologies. Traffic benchmarks and practical case studies using a cycle-accurate simulation environment indicate significantly reduced insertion loss providing improved bandwidth density and scalability to many core plurality. Improvements in system performance parameters are quantified fornetwork bandwidth, transmission efficiency, and latency in popular photonic internconnection topologies, in comparison to previous switch designs. For instance, utilizing the Helix-h switch in a mesh topology, the bandwidth is increased by 112% compared to the previously highest performing switch design. Execution time and energy efficiency are improved by up to 92% and 99%, respectively, for representative multicore applications. Finally, the technique is generalized to a novel graph-theoretic method for articulating blocking conditions in photonic switches.",

		"abstract": "On-chip communication is widely considered to be one of the major performance bottlenecks in contemporary chip multiprocessors (CMPs). With recent advances in silicon nanophotonics, photonic-based networks-on-chip (NoCs) are being considered as a viable option for communication in emerging CMPs as they can enable higher bandwidth and lower power dissipation compared to traditional electrical NoCs. In this paper, we present UltraNoC, a novel reconfigurable silicon-photonic NoC architecture that features improved channel sharing and supports dynamic re-prioritization and exchange of bandwidth between clusters of cores running multiple applications, to increase channel utilization and performance. Experimental results show that UltraNoC improves throughput by up to 9.8× while reducing latency by up to 55% and energy-delay product by up to 90% over state-of-the-art solutions.",

		"abstract": "Computation of optical flow is a fundamental step in computer vision applications. However, due to its high complexity, it is difficult to compute a high-accuracy optical flow field in real time. This paper proposes a parallel computing approach for fast computation of high-accuracy optical flow field. It is specially designed for Tilera, a typical many-core processor with 36 tiles. By efficiently exploiting the advantages of the mesh architecture of Tilera, and by appropriately handling the parallelism inherent in the optical flow computation, the proposed implemention is able to significantly reduce the computation time while keep a low power consumption. Experiment shows that, for a 640×480640×480640 {\\times } 480 image, the computation time is only 0.80 seconds per frame. It is 2.56 times faster than on a typical CPU i3-3240 (3.4GHz), and the power consumption as less as 1/6. Experimental results also show that the proposed parallel approach is highly scalable for variable requirements on computation speeds and power consumptions, since it can flexibly selects a proper number of computing cores.",

		"abstract": "Moore's law for traditional electric integrated circuits is facing increasingly more challenges in both physics and economics. Among those challenges is the fact that the bandwidth per compute on the chip is dropping, whereas the energy needed for data movement keeps rising. We benchmark various interconnect technologies, including electrical, photonic, and plasmonic options. We contrast them with hybrid photonic-plasmonic interconnect(s) [HyPPI(s)], where we consider plasmonics for active manipulation devices and photonics for passive propagation integrated circuit elements and further propose another novel hybrid link that utilizes an on-chip laser for intrinsic modulation, thus bypassing electrooptic modulation. Our analysis shows that such hybridization will overcome the shortcomings of both pure photonic and plasmonic links. Furthermore, it shows superiority in a variety of performance parameters such as point-to-point latency, energy efficiency, throughput, energy delay product, crosstalk coupling length, and bit flow density, which is a new metric that we defined to reveal the tradeoff between the footprint and performance. Our proposed HyPPIs show significantly superior performance compared with other links.",

However, the nanophotonic interconnects are sensitive to process and thermal variations, especially for the microring structures, resulting in significant variation of an optical link's bit error rate (BER). In this paper, we propose a power-efficient adaptive tuning approach for nanophotonic interconnects to address the variation issues. During the adaptive tuning process, each nanophotonic interconnect is adaptively allocated just enough power to meet the BER requirement. The proposed adaptive tuning approach could reduce the photonic receiver power by 8% - 34% than the worst-case based fixed design while achieving the same BER. Our evaluation results show that the adaptive tuning approach scales well with the process variation, the thermal variation and the number of communication nodes, and can accommodate different types of NoC architectures and lasers.",

		"abstract": "Many researchers are currently at work to assess the congruent multiples in performance and energy efficiency that should be expected by the photonic integration of multi and many-core processors. However, such processors and their interconnection networks are typically viewed as monolithic resources, which fails to capture the most recent trends in the usage model of these computation-rich devices. In fact, partitioning of computation and communication resources is gaining momentum as a way of enabling application concurrency, and of consolidating software functions with heterogeneous requirements onto the same platform. Optical NoCs have never been embodied in this context. This work bridges this gap and proposes a partitioning technology for wavelength-routed ONoCs, including an algorithm for online allocation of wavelengths, that aims at their maximum reuse across partitions. This way, laser sources that are not inuse at a given point in time can be powered-off, thus mitigating the most significant contribution to static power dissipation in optical NoCs.",

		"abstract": "Moore's law and the continuity of device scaling have led to an increasing number of cores/nodes on a chip, creating a need for new mechanisms to achieve high-performance and power-efficient Network-on-Chip (NoC). Nanophotonics based NoCs provide for higher bandwidth and more power efficient designs than electronic networks. Present approaches often use an external laser source, ring resonators, and waveguides. However, they still suffer from important limitations: large static power consumption, and limited network scalability. In this article, we explore the use of emerging molecular scale devices to construct nanophotonic networks: Molecular-scale Network-on-Chip (mNoC). We leverage on-chip emitters such as quantum dot LEDs, which provide electrical to optical signal modulation, and chromophores, which provide optical signal filtering for receivers. These devices replace the ring resonators and the external laser source used in contemporary nanophotonic NoCs. They reduce energy consumption or enable scaling to larger crossbars for a reduced energy budget. We present a Single Writer Multiple Reader (SWMR) bus based crossbar mNoC. Our evaluation shows that an mNoC can achieve more than 88% reduction in energy for a 64×64 crossbar compared to similar ring resonator based designs. Additionally, an mNoC can scale to a 256×256 crossbar with an average 10% performance improvement and 54% energy reduction.",

		"abstract": "In synchronous networks-on-chip (NoC), scheduling of packet transmission is required for achieving high throughput, low latency and good fairness, while avoiding packet collisions. Efficient algorithms exist for rearrangeably non-blocking NoC. However, when realized with integrated optical devices, NoC are typically arranged in topologies that are blocking if a single wavelength is used. Mitigation of the blocking behavior is then achieved by exploiting the wavelength domain, which requires however a novel scheduling paradigm. This paper presents an integrated optical NoC based on a ring topology and realized with multiple resonating microrings (MMR). Scheduling in MMR architecture comprises the conventional matching sub-problem along with wavelength assignment sub-problem, which accounts for the additional constraints due to the wavelength domain. A novel scheduling algorithm based on iSLIP algorithm is proposed for jointly addressing both sub-problems. The iterative Parallel Wavelength Matching (iPWM) algorithm achieves performance similar to a two-step scheduler based on sequential iSLIP and first-fit wavelength assignment, but with a computational complexity lower and independent of the number of wavelengths.",

		"abstract": "Crosstalk noise can significantly reduce data transfer reliability in emerging photonic network-on-chip (PNoC) architectures. Undesirable mode coupling between photonic signals at microring resonators (MR) is the main cause of crosstalk in photonic waveguides. As emerging PNoC architectures employ dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) with multiple cascaded MRs, these architectures suffer from high crosstalk levels. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to this problem, by increasing the wavelength spacing between adjacent wavelengths in a DWDM waveguide to reduce crosstalk noise. Experimental results on two photonic crossbar architectures (Corona and Firefly) indicate that our approach improves worst-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by up to 51.7%.",

However, optical circuit switching requires an electrical control network, which leads to network congestion, low network utilization, high latency, and an overhead in energy consumption. In this letter, we propose an architecture called RPNoC based on ring topology using packet switching. A wavelength assignment method and a deadlock-free deterministic routing algorithm are jointly designed, which significantly reduce the maximum number of hops using much fewer optical devices compared with other packet-switched ONoCs. The simulation is carried out for 64-node RPNoC under uniform and realistic traffic pattern.

		"abstract": "Three-Dimensional Networks-on-Chips (3D-NoCs) have been proposed as an auspicious solution, merging the high parallelism of the Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm with the high-performance and low-power of 3D-ICs. However, as feature sizes and power supply voltages continually decrease, the devices and interconnects have become more vulnerable to transient errors. Transient errors, or soft errors, have severe consequences on chip performance, such as deadlock, data corruption, packet loss and increased packet latency. In this paper, we propose a soft-error resilient 3D-NoC router (SER-3DR) architecture for highly-reliable many-core Systems-on-Chips. The proposed architecture is able to recover from transient errors occurring in different pipeline stages of the SER-3DR.We implemented the architecture in hardware with 45 nm CMOS technology. Evaluation results show that SER-3DR is able to achieve a high level of transient error protection with a latency increase of 18.16%, an additional area cost of 14.98% and a power overhead of 5.90% when compared to the baseline router architecture.",

		"abstract": "In this paper we propose a methodology to simulate the optical filtering system of a camera module with limited access to proprietary data. The target of the simulation is the virtual prototyping of the overall camera module for a fine tuning of the auto-focus mechanism. For the optical system modeling, the methodology is based on the usage of some point spread functions (PSFs). The use of the full set of PSFs is computationally costly and memory space consuming hence compromising the usability of the optical model in the full system virtual prototyping. To improve the model execution time, PSFs interpolation and free-space propagation techniques are used: they allow reducing the sampling space with minimal impact on the accuracy of the model (sharpness error less than 2%). The total speed-up gain with respect to the standard non-optimized model is provided by two contributors. First, the interpolation technique leads to a speed-up linked to the PSFs number reduction. Second, the caching of computationally intense processes enables speed-up scaling with the number of frames.",
