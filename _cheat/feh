feh /opt/images
        Show all images in /opt/images

feh -r /opt/images
        Recursively show all images found in /opt/images and
        subdirectories

feh -rSfilename /opt/images
        Same as above, but sort by filename. By default, feh will show
        files in the order it finds them on the hard disk, which is
        usually somewhat random.

feh -t -Sfilename -E 128 -y 128 -W 1024 /opt/images
        Show 128x128 pixel thumbnails, limit window width to 1024 pixels.

feh -t -Sfilename -E 128 -y 128 -W 1024 -P -C
        /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/ -e DejaVuSans/8 /opt/images
        Same as above, but enable thumbnail caching in ~/.thumbnails and
        use a smaller font.

feh -irFarial/14 -O index.jpg /opt/images
        Make an index print of /opt/images and all directories below it,
        using 14 point Arial to write the image info under each
        thumbnail.  Save the image as index.jpg and don't display it,
        just exit.  Note that this even works without a running X server

feh --unloadable -r /opt/images
        Print all unloadable images in /opt/images, recursively

feh -f by_width -S width --reverse --list .
        Write a list of all images in the directory to by_width, sorted
        by width (widest images first)

feh -w /opt/images/holidays
        Open each image in /opt/images/holidays in its own window

feh -FD5 -Sname /opt/images/presentation
        Show the images in .../presentation, sorted by name, in
        fullscreen, automatically change to the next image after 5
        seconds

feh -rSwidth -A "mv %F ~/images/%N" /opt/images
        View all images in /opt/images and below, sorted by width, move
        an image to ~/image/image_name when enter is pressed

feh --start-at ./foo.jpg .
        View all images in the current directory, starting with foo.jpg.
        All other images are still in the slideshow and can be viewed
        normally

feh --start-at foo.jpg *
        Same as above

feh --info "exifgrep '(Model|DateTimeOriginal|FNumber|ISO|Flash)' %F |
        cut -d . -f 4-" .
        Show some EXIF information, extracted by exifprobe/exifgrep

feh --action 'rm %F' -rl --max-dim 1000x800
        Resursively remove all images with dimensions below or equal to
        1000x800 pixels from the current directory.
